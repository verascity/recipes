This is sort of a "recipe;" I've never written down amounts and I'm probably not going 
to start now! Use these guidelines and trust your palate and you'll end up with the best
butternut squash soup in the world.

You will need:
1 butternut squash, cut into chunks
chicken stock or salted water (vegetable stock changes the flavor too much; if you are a
vegetarian and want to add more flavor, choose a vegetable base without tomato flavor)
SMALL bay leaf
curry powder
ground cumin
ground cinnamon
five spice powder
ground ginger
ground cardamom
cayenne pepper
chili powder
honey
salt
black pepper
butter or vegan substitute (optional)
milk or dairy substitute (optional; I like a splash of almond milk)


1. Put squash chunks, stock/water, salt, pepper, and bay leaf in a large pot on the stove over medium-high heat and simmer until soft. 
2. Remove bay leaf. Blend in food processor, blender, or with an immersion blender (my implement 
of choice!).
3. Add spices and flavorings in the following estimated quantities:

A LOT OF: curry powder, cinnamon, honey
A MEDIUM AMOUNT OF: cumin, ginger
A LITTLE: five spice, cardamom, chili, cayenne
Salt and pepper to taste. 

Taste as you add flavorings; start CONSERVATIVELY and add more as you go, especially if this
is new to you. 

4. For a richer and smoother soup, cut in a couple of tablespoons of butter/substitute and up
to a half a cup or so of milk (I use less) and blend again.

5. Serve and eat warm. This soup keeps wonderfully for days in the fridge or months in the
freezer.

Optional step 6: Add a topping for texture! Some toppings that have worked well for me are:

crumbled bacon
crushed nuts (pecans or walnuts)
lightly fried herbs (sage, thyme, rosemary)
